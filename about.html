      <p>The Heaven IQ Test was produced by TAC &ndash; an independent, non-profit ministry. Contact us by pressing the button below or emailing us at <a href="./feedback.html">feedback@heaveniqtest.com.</a> We enjoy hearing from you!</p>
      <h2>Our Story:</h2>
      <p>I was listening to a couple of dj's on a Christian radio station on my way to work one morning. They were discussing how to get to Heaven. They sounded so knowledgeable, so good, and so devout &mdash; but Jesus said nothing like what they were promoting!</p>
      <p>Because this is so common in the modern world, we made the Heaven IQ Test. Our site centers on Jesus's salvation teachings as recorded in the Bible. To have as little religious bias as possible, we use different Bibles popular in the modern world.</p>
      <p>Although we are confident that you will enjoy are work, we recommend reading the entire New Testament yourself to "hear" what Jesus emphasized. Chances are, you will notice differences between what Jesus focuses on and what many religions teach &mdash; maybe even your own!</p>
      <p>Take the time to follow Jesus and study what He says about Heaven &mdash; your eternal happiness depends on it!</p>
