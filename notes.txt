NOTES


-File Tree: I will have all the code files in the main directory. Each page will have a html, css, and js file (e.g. index.html, index.css, index.js).

-Index: This is the name of the main page files.

-Image Formats: I notice the images in bruce's site are webp instead of png. Consider looking into that

-Color Picking: For each page I have an html file containing just the mockup image. This is so that I can use the color picker browser extension on the picture. [hm or i could ha just put that picture of the text in and then color picked and compared from there]

-Font Optimizing: it would be good if i can get that otf as a woff/woff2 somehow

-Shadow Difficulties: perhaps it has to do with transparency or opacity?
